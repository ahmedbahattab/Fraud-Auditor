# Fraud Auditor: A Visual Analytics Approach For Collusive Fraud in
Health Insurance (Deep Learning)
Collusive fraud, in which multiple fraudsters collude to defraud health insurance funds, threatens the operation
of the healthcare system. However, existing statistical and machine learning-based methods have limited
ability to detect fraud in the scenario of health insurance due to the high similarity of fraudulent behaviors to
normal medical visits and the lack of labeled data. To ensure the accuracy of the detection results, expert
knowledge needs to be integrated with the fraud detection process. By working closely with health insurance
audit experts, we propose FraudAuditor, a three-stage visual analytics approach to collusive fraud detection in
health insurance. Specifically, we first allow users to interactively construct a co-visit network to holistically
model the visit relationships of different patients. Second, an improved community detection algorithm that
considers the strength of fraud likelihood is designed to detect suspicious fraudulent groups. Finally, through
our visual interface, users can compare, investigate, and verify suspicious patient behavior with tailored
visualizations that support different time scales. We conducted case studies in a real-world healthcare scenario,
i.e., to help locate the actual fraud group and exclude the false positive group. The results and expert feedback
proved the effectiveness and usability of the approach.
